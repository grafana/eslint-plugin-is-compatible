# eslint-plugin-is-compatible

This repo is based on the "[Writing a custom ESLint plugin with Typescript](https://thesonofthomp.medium.com/writing-a-custom-eslint-plugin-with-typescript-08d0e01726d2)" Medium article written by [Adam Thompson
](https://github.com/thesonofthomp).

## Why this repo?

I was expecting to find a link to a repo with the full code explained in Adam's article but I could not find it.

It will be a quick way to browse the full code on its own and possibly to enhance it by fixing issues.

## Getting started

I worked on this repo using `npm` but it should work with other package manager.

### Install

`npm i`

### Build

`npm build`

### Test

`npm test`

### Docs

`npm docs:init` will create new files for each rule if necessary.

`npm docs:update` will update existing files and the rules list.

You can see an example of generated documentation in the next section.

### Rules

<!-- begin auto-generated rules list -->

ðŸ’¡ Manually fixable by [editor suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/core-concepts#rule-suggestions).
